Project Description:

This is a website commenting on the nature of standardized testing in hopes of lifting anxiety on student's shoulders and allowing them to not 
define themselves by the grades they receive using localStorage. This project aims to reassure students taking large exams that one exam in their 
youth is not indicative of who they are or what they're capable of. 



Design Process:

For this quiz design-wise, I wanted to mimick the actual papers students would read and write on during the SATs, mainly keeping the design very simple, 
minimal, and to the point. I also included the color light blue as it is widely known as a comforting color. In addition, content-wise, I wanted the test 
to focus on math problems increasing in difficulty until the user reaches the ending page in which their stress is relieved. For each question, I used 
localstorage to save their multiple choice answers if they chose to go back to previous questions. I also used localstorage to save the user's name on the 
index page in order to address them later on.



Reflection: 

This assignment allowed me to have more empathy for my target audience as I once was in their shoes feeling the anxiety and stress of large exams such as 
the SATs. From my quiz, I hope that some of the anxiety is lifted once they reach the end of the quiz and understand how one exam will not define your 
future. For future improvements, I definitely would want to successfully include a countdown timer using localstorage since I ran into multiple issues 
when trying to include this feature in the quiz. I would also want to expand the quiz content beyond math and into other subjects.
